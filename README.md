## 📱 Application Overview

The application displays a single screen containing:
- My name
- A short description of what I did over the summer
- My favorite mobile applications and why I enjoy using them

All text is rendered using React Native’s `<Text>` components inside a `<View>` container.  
Basic styling is applied using `StyleSheet` to center the content and change the background color.

The app updates live when changes are made to `App.js`, demonstrating Expo’s hot reload feature.
